# 🧬 AbAgym: A Curated Dataset for Antibody-Antigen Mutations

Welcome to **AbAgym**, a manually curated dataset containing 68 deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets on antibody-antigen complexes, along with the 3D structure of each complex. The dataset includes around **324,000 non-redundant mutations**, including 36,541 interface mutations, which can support the development and evaluation of computational methods for antibody design and immune escape prediction.

In the AbAgym data files, the score of each mutation is given by the DMS_score column. This score originates from deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments and is therefore not a direct experimental measurement of binding affinity changes upon mutation. Although related, DMS scores and binding affinities are not equivalent, and DMS scores depend on the specific experimental assay used. As noted in our publication, different assay types produce scores with varying ranges. Some assays output scores between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates complete neutralization (no effect on binding) and 1 indicates full immune escape. Others produce scores ranging from negative to positive values: in these cases, 0 typically indicates no effect, positive scores indicate escape mutations, and negative scores suggest enhanced binding. If you plan to use this dataset to train a ML model, it could be necessary to normalize the scores across datasets to account for these differences; we provide two normalized DMS_score columns (MinMax and RankQuartile normalized). For details, please refer to our publication and Supplementary Material.
